This file gives information on how to compile "glv" from the source.

***DEPENDENCY:  GLUT library

Before building the application; make sure GLUT is installed on your system.

Binaries or source-code distributions are available:
Linux/Unixes: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut_downloads.html
Windows: http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

***LINUX/UNIXES

  (To ensure a correct build, GLUT should be available in the system
   include/library paths.  Or, copied in the src directory.)

  Note to RedHat 9.0: users should not use the RPM provided in the
      distribution as it is not working properly. 
      See https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2047427
      and https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2047596

  Just do "make"
  application "glv" is now compiled.


***WINDOWS

  Windows is a minor compatibility/test platform.  glv is not meant for windows.
  (To ensure a correct build, add GLUT include/libraries in the paths of
   visualC; or configure the project so that glut.h and glut32.lib are
   used)
  
  VisualC++:
    Create a new Console application project
    Add all src/*.cpp files
    Project->Settings->Link:  Add "opengl32.lib glu32.lib glut32.lib"
    Make!

  (At run time; glut32.dll must be available)
